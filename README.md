# DarthJarJar-Dromous_SCDFXIBM
A life saving application designed to automatically detect road accidents.

---

## Short Description:

### The Problem:

In 2018,there were almost 8000 road casualties in Singapore. Furthermore, Singapore has a road fatality rate of 2.8%, which is higher than many other large cities, more than double of Tokyo's, in fact. A big part of the problem comes from the delay between accident and aid. In life-threatening situations, every second makes a difference, and the time between an accident actually occuring, and the emergency services being called up, either by a victim or a witness, is a large portion of that.

### The Solution

We wanted to implement a system that could cut out that time entirely, by automatically detecting road accidents, and alerting emergency services. Therefore, our team (Darth Jar Jar) of 4 high school students (Samud Suhas Shetty, Devam Jain, Preetish Juneja and Madhav Lodha), decided to create Dromous. Our solution is an AI-enabled service that automatically detects road accidents, and alerts the relevant authorities.

Our solution is made up of four components:
1. Hardware, in the form of our self-designed plug-in module to in-car cameras, and pre-existing on road cameras
2. Software, in the form of the IBM Watson Machine Learning and Watson Visual Recognition systems
3. Python code, written to identify the location of crashes based on the location of on-road cameras
4. A web app, to signal the end user of the site, time and confidence level of the occurunce of an accident

## Getting Started
##### The code used to train our model is given [here](https://github.com/DJrocks192s/DarthJarJar-Dromous_SCDFXIBM/blob/master/MaterialsFolder/Visual%20Recognition%20Model%20Code.ipynb). We have only included the training of one image adding the object "car" to a visible car in the image. We used similar code for around 150 images that we used to train the model.
