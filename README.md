# DarthJarJar-Dromous_SCDFXIBM
A life saving application designed to automatically detect road accidents.

---

## Short description of the problem and the idea:
Seeing that there were 7680 car accidents in Singapore in 2018, we decided to help the victims of these tragic incidents by creating Dromous. Our application uses models created using Watson Machine Learning Model and Watson Cloud Annotate in order to detect cars from any other objects present in camera footage. The cameras will be connected using bluetooth receiver to phone and hence to the cloud in order to transmit data to the visual recognition model on the cloud (use of IoT) in order for the AI to determine the passing by of cars. A SD card is also connected to the camera so that the recording never stops even when the phone is not connected via bluetooth. The AI model is also trained with multpile images and types of car crashes which it can detect from camera footage and automatically alert SCDF to provide immediate support for the victims and hence save the lives of those involved.
